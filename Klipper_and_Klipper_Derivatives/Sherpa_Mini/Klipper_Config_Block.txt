These are good starting settings for the extruder, I have copy pasted my entire block out of my klipper config below:

# Extruder0
[extruder]
rotation_distance: 22.67895 #for 5mm Shaft Driven Bondtech gearsets
#gear_ratio: 50:10 #for standard 10t motor
gear_ratio: 50:8 #for sherpa mini 8t motor
microsteps: 16
full_steps_per_rotation: 200 #1.8deg Motor

max_extrude_only_distance: 1400.0
max_extrude_only_velocity: 75.0

#Run current is listed in RMS
run_current: 0.30 #min current, equivalent to 0.42A peak (Peak = RMS/0.707)
#run_current: 0.35 #max current, equivalent to 0.49A peak (Peak = RMS/0.707)

#starting point for retraction tuning
#retraction speed: 30mm/s - do not exceed this speed
#retraction distance: 0.4mm
