Firmware configurations and guides for ANNEX Printers

## Danger Klipper
### Reasoning:
Currently, the ANNEX team recommends using the "Danger Klipper" fork instead of the mainline version of klipper. 

Danger Klipper is a bleeding edge fork of the excellent Klipper firmware. It was created be more community driven, and to support features unavailable in mainline Klipper, such as the most recent PID improvements and our "Dockable Probe" Module.
Some of these features were rejected for integration into mainline Klipper for a variety of reasons, including their perceved novelty and usefulness to only a potentially small number of users. We hope that by supporting these features, their use can be expanded to a broader user base, their functionality refined, and their community value to be more easily determined. Ultimately, we believe the "less conservative nature" of this firmware is more aligned with the philsophy of ANNEX and its userbase, and will only serve to benefit the entire community as a whole.
